# Chipster

Chipster is an app that enables users to design their own logic circuits using various logic gates, such as input (IN), output (OUT), NOT, AND, OR, and XOR. I built it for my submission to Apple's [Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/) this year. 

## Setup

To use Chipster, you need an iPad with Swift Playground, or a Mac with Xcode or Swift Playgrounds installed. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Add the extension **.swiftpm** to the project
3. Open the project in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds.
4. Run the project on your iPad or Mac.
5. Start designing your logic circuits!

## Features

- Drag and drop logic gates onto the canvas.
- Connect the gates to create circuits.
- Test your circuits using the input/output components.
